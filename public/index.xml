Although the frequentist way of applying Statistics is not discarded, the way I liked the most is the Bayesian approach.</description>

      <description>Research Interests Alan Gelfand told me once that the best way to describe what we do is to say that we are stochastic modellers. That is what I try to do, to model complex real situations in the presence of uncertainty. To do so, the way I liked the most is the Bayesian approach. Being from Valencia, this can be considered as kind of natural.
In line with this, I have been involved in the analysis of waiting lists for transplants, efficiency of banks, early detection of epidemics, environmental performance, and so on.</description>
