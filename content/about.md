## Research Interests

Someone told me that the best way to describe what I do is to say that I am a stochastic modeller. Although the frequentist way of applying Statistics is not discarded, the way I liked the most  is the Bayesian approach. Being from Valencia, this can be considered as kind of natural.

My main interest has been always in applying Statistics in the real world. In line with this, I have been involved in the analysis of waiting lists for transplants, efficiency of banks, early detection of epidemics, environmental performance, and so on. Since 2010, species distribution has been my main focus, with papers related to the describing the spatial distribution of plant diseases, veterinary diseases, and fish species.
