## Research Interests

Alan Gelfand told me once that the best way to describe what we do is to say that we are **stochastic modellers**. That is what I try to do, to model complex real situations in the presence of uncertainty. To do so, the way I liked the most is the Bayesian approach. Being from Valencia, this can be considered as kind of natural.

In line with this, I have been involved in the analysis of waiting lists for transplants, efficiency of banks, early detection of epidemics, environmental performance, and so on. Since 2010, species distribution models has been my main focus, with works related to find the statistical tools and the best models that could help us to describe the spatial distribution of plant diseases, veterinary diseases, and fish species.
